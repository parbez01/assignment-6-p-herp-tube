        <p class="bg-sky-400 text-2xl text-center p-6 mt-4 font-bold">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const?</p>

        <div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 m-4">
            <div class="bg-green-400 h-auto rounded-xl p-6 text-xl " >
                <p> <span class="font-extrabold">var:
                    <br>
                </span>
                    Function Scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are visible throughout the function in which they are declared, even if they are declared inside blocks (if statements or loops).
                    Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This means you can use a var variable before it's declared in the code, although it will have an initial value of undefined.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg-red-400 h-auto rounded-xl p-6 text-xl" >
                <p>
                    <span class="font-extrabold">let:</span>
                        <br>
    
                    Block Scope: Variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they are limited to the block
                    (inside curly braces) where they are defined.
                    They are not hoisted to the top of their enclosing block.
                    Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ): Variables declared with let have a temporal dead zone, which means you cannot
                    access them before their declaration within
                    the block scope. Trying to access a let variable before its declaration results in a ReferenceError.

            <div class="bg-yellow-300 h-auto rounded-xl p-6 text-xl" >
                <p>
                    <span class="font-extrabold">const:
                        <br>
                    </span>
                    Block Scope: Like let, variables declared with const are block-scoped.
                    Immutability: Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.
                    However, for objects and arrays declared with const,
                    their properties or elements can be modified, but the reference itself cannot be changed.

                Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.
